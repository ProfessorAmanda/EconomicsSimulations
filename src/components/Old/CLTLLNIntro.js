              <p> This simulation demonstrates the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Suppose I draw a large number of samples, each of size ùëõ, from some population. For each sample, I calculate a sample mean ùë•ÃÖ. I now plot a histogram of those sample means. For a sufficiently large sample size, the shape of that histogram will look like a beautiful bell-shaped curve, no matter what shape the underlying population had.</p>
