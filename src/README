Purpose: The document decribes the files in this folder in an order
corresponding to the flow of the app.

-src/APP.js:
 Contains code responsible for initial "Econ Simulations" animation
 Calls on SimulationMenu.js

--src/components/SimulationMenu.js
  Code calls on 7 other files. It first executes on StartHere.js. Once The
  "start" button is clicked, the program executes SimBar.js and LawOfLargeNumbers.js,
  CentralLimitTheorem.js, JointWrapper.js, LeastSim.js, OmmittedVariable.js, or
  ConfidenceIntervals.js (based on the current state).

---src/components/StartHere.js
   Displays text including subtitles, contributors, and "start" button.

---src/components/SimBar.js
   Structures the layout and displays the name and description for each feature.

---src/components/LawOfLargeNumbers.js
   Displays a text description of the Law of Large numbers. The file calls on
   PopBar.js which sets the this.state.popType and executes Normal.js, Uniform.js,
   Exponential.js, or ChiSquared.js based on that state.

----src/components/popBar.js
    Displays "Pick a Population Distribution" and the appropriate distributions
    to choose from.

----src/components/LawOfLargeNumbers/Normal.js
----src/components/LawOfLargeNumbers/Uniform.js
----src/components/LawOfLargeNumbers/Exponential.js
----src/components/LawOfLargeNumbers/ChiSquared.js
    Each file contain a unique function (ex. generateNormal()), to generate
    the random data for the selected distribution. This data is displayed using
    ChartContainer.js. After this step, the user is prompted to "Try a few
    different sample sizes and compare sample mean to population mean",
    this is done via SampleArea.js

-----src/components/ChartContainer.js
     Uses highchart api to display a scatter plot for the random data with
     different labels and axis limits depending on the chosen distribution.
     Passes the population random data to PopTable

------src/components/popTable.js
      Displays a table of the given array

-----src/components/SampleArea.js
     Allows the user to input a sample mean, it does a calculationa and then
     graphs Population VS Sample Means for the given distribution.

---src/components/CentralLimitTheorem.js --- analougous to LawOfLargeNumbers.js
----src/components/popBar.js
----src/components/CentralLimitTheorem/Normal.js
----src/components/CentralLimitTheorem/Uniform.js
----src/components/CentralLimitTheorem/Exponential.js
----src/components/CentralLimitTheorem/ChiSquared.js
----src/components/CentralLimitTheorem/Mystery.js
-----src/components/ChartContainer.js
------src/components/popTable.js
-----src/components/SampleArea.js

---src/components/LeastSim.js
   Allows the user to randomly generate a certain amount of points based on
   their input. The user is prompted to guess the y-intercept and slope of the
   line of best fit. The program plots the line and lets the user adjust their
   answer or reveal the line of best fit with the smalled sum of squares.

#I am unfamilar with these files. I did not work on them while I was an RA.
---src/components/JointWrapper.js
   Code for "Joint Distributions" feature

---src/components/OmmittedVariable.js
   Code for "Omitted Variable Bias" feature

---src/components/ConfidenceIntervals.js
   Code for "Confidence Intervals" feature, not included in app
